\subsection{Total Variation}

\begin{definition}{Complex Measure}*
    Let \((X, \fr{M})\) be a measurable space. A complex measure \(\mu : \fr{M} \to \bb{C}\) satisfies \tit{countable additivity}, in the sense that if \(E \in \fr{M}\) is partitioned into \(\{E_n\}_{n} \subseteq \fr{M}\), then 
    \[
        \mu(E) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(E_n)
        \qquad (E \in \fr{M})
    \]
\end{definition}

The series must converge \tit{absolutely}, since the partition does not depend on the order of the sum. Neither does it depend on the particular choice of partition. This motivates the following definition. 

\begin{definition}{Total Variation Measure}*
    Let \((X, \fr{M}, \mu)\) be a complex measure space. For \(E \in \fr{M}\), let \(\fr{P}(E)\) denote the collection of (measurable) partitions of \(E\). The \tit{total variation measure} is
    \[
        |\mu|(E) := \sup_{\{E_n\}_n \in \fr{P}(E)} \, \sum_{n=1}^\infty |\mu(E_n)|
        \equiv \sup \sum_{n=1}^\infty |\mu(E_n)|
    \]

    and the \tit{total variation} of \(\mu\) is \(|\mu|(X)\). 
\end{definition}

The total variation measure \(|\mu|\) can be thought of as the smallest positive measure which dominates a (complex) measure \(\mu\). If \(\mu\) is a positive measure, though, of course \(|\mu| = \mu\). 
\stdvspace

\begin{theorem}{Total Variation Measure}*
    The total variation \(|\mu|\) of a complex measure \(\mu : \fr{M} \to \bb{C}\) is a positive measure. 
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    To show countable additivity, first consider the forward direction \(\sum_n |\mu|(E_n) \leq |\mu|(E)\). The idea is to partition each of the \(E_n\), which collectively forms a new partition of \(E\). For each \(E_n\), there exists \(t_n \in \bb{R}\) such that \(|\mu|(E_n) > t_n\). By the approximation property of the supremum, there exists a partition \(\{E_{nm}\}_m\) such that 
    \[
        t_n < \sum_{m=1}^\infty |\mu(E_{nm})|
        \implies
        \sum_{n=1}^\infty t_n \leq \sum_{n,m=1}^\infty |\mu(E_{nm})|
        \leq |\mu|(E) 
    \]

    since \(\{E_{nm}\}_{n,m}\) partitions \(E\). However, taking the supremum over \(t_n\) yields \(\sum_n |\mu|(E_n) \leq |\mu|(E)\). For the reverse direction, we want to show that \(|\mu|(E) \leq \sum_n |\mu|(E_n)\). If we can show that
    \[
        \sum_{m=1}^\infty |\mu(A_m)| \leq \sum_{n=1}^\infty |\mu|(E_n)
    \]

    for any partition \(\{A_m\}_m\) of \(E\), then the claim will follow. The only way to make these two distinct partitions comparable is to look at their pairwise intersections \(\{E_n \cap A_m\}_{n,m}\), e.g. as follows: 
    \begin{align*}
        \sum_{m=1}^\infty |\mu(A_m)|
        &= \sum_{m=1}^\infty \left| \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(E_n \cap A_m) \right| 
        \leq \sum_{m=1}^\infty \sum_{n=1}^\infty |\mu(E_n \cap A_m)| \\
        &= \sum_{n=1}^\infty \sum_{m=1}^\infty |\mu(E_n \cap A_m)|
        \leq \sum_{n=1}^\infty |\mu|(E_n)
    \end{align*}

    so \(|\mu|(E) \leq \sum_n |\mu|(E_n)\). Hence actually \(|\mu|(E) = \sum_n |\mu|(E_n)\), proving countable additivity. Finally, to show that there exists a set \(F \in \fr{M}\) for which \(|\mu|(F) < \infty\), we can take \(F = \varnothing\). Since the only partition of \(\varnothing\) is \(\{\varnothing\}_n\) and \(\mu(\varnothing) = 0\), we conclude that \(|\mu|(\varnothing) = 0\). 
\end{proof}

\subsection{Bounded Variation}

\begin{lemma}{Average Modulus}*
    If \(\{z_i\}_{i=1}^N \subseteq \bb{C}\) then there is \(S \subseteq \{1, \dots, N\}\) such that 
    \[
        \left| \sum_{k \in S} z_k \right| \geq \frac{1}{\pi} \sum_{k=1}^N |z_k|
    \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Represent each \(z_k\) as \(|z_k| e^{i\alpha_k}\) for \(\alpha_k \in [-\pi, \pi]\). For each \(\theta \in [-\pi, \pi]\), we define \(S(\theta)\) to be the indices of the \(z_k\) which are “aligned” with \(\theta\), in the sense that 
    \[
        S(\theta) = \{k \mid \cos(\alpha_k - \theta) > 0\}
    \]

    By taking the real part, we can bound
    \begin{align*}
        \left| \sum_{k \in S(\theta)} z_k \right| 
        &\geq \Re \left( \sum_{k \in S(\theta)} |z_k| e^{i \alpha_k} \right)
        \geq \sum_{k \in S(\theta)} |z_k| \cos(\alpha_k - \theta)
        = \sum_{k=1}^N |z_k| \cos^+(\alpha_k - \theta)
        =: \varphi(\theta)
    \end{align*}

    Let \(\theta_0\) be the value of \(\theta\) which maximizes \(\varphi(\theta)\) on the compact interval \([- \pi, \pi]\). This value is at least as large as the average, \(\varphi(\theta_0) \geq \overline{\varphi(\theta)}\). But the average with respect to \(\theta\) is 
    \begin{align*}
        \overline{\varphi(\theta)} 
        &= \sum_{k=1}^N |z_k| \overline{\cos^+(\alpha_k - \theta)}
        = \sum_{k=1}^N \Bigl( |z_k| \cdot \tfrac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi \cos^+(\alpha_k - \theta) \, d\theta \Bigr) \\
        &= \sum_{k=1}^N |z_k| \cdot \tfrac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^\pi \cos^+ \theta \, d\theta
        = \sum_{k=1}^N |z_k| \cdot \int_{-\pi/2}^{\pi/2} \cos \theta \, d\theta
        = \frac{1}{\pi} \sum_{k=1}^N |z_k| 
    \end{align*}

    Assigning \(S := S(\theta_0)\) therefore completes the proof. 
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}{Bounded Variation}*
    If \(\mu\) is a complex measure on \(X\), then \(|\mu|(X) < \infty\).
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
    The idea is that we can bisect any measurable set \(E\) into halves with measure absolutely greater than 1. Recursing this process will yield a partition of \(E\) whose members have measure absolutely greater than 1, which will violate additivty since \(\mu\) is complex and thus finite. 
    \stdvspace

    For contradiction, take any \(E \in \fr{M}\) such that \(|\mu|(E) = \infty\). Define \(t = \pi(1 + |\mu(E)|)\), so \(t < \infty = |\mu|(E)\). By the approximation property of the supremum, there exists a partition \(\{E_n\}_n \in \fr{P}(E)\) such that \(\sum_n |\mu(E_n)| > t\). By definition of the limit, there exists \(N\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^N |\mu(E_i)| > t\).
    \stdvspace

    Let \(z_i = \mu(E_i)\) and apply the previous lemma to obtain a subset \(S \subseteq \{1, \dots, N\}\) such that
    \[
        \left| \sum_{k \in S} \mu(E_k) \right| \geq \frac{1}{\pi} \sum_{i=1}^N |\mu(E_i)|
        \implies A := \bigcup_{k \in S} E_k
        \implies |\mu(A)| > \frac{t}{\pi} > 1
    \]
    where the last equality follows from additivity. Now, let \(B := E \setminus A\). Then 
    \[
        |\mu(B)| = |\mu(E) - \mu(A)| 
        \geq |\mu(A)| - |\mu(E)|
        > 1 + |\mu(E)| - |\mu(E)|
        = 1
    \]
    So, we have a partition \(\{A, B\}\) of \(E\) whose members have measure absolutely greater than 1. Now, either \(|\mu|(A) = \infty\) or \(|\mu|(B) = \infty\), since \(|\mu|\) is countably additive. Without loss of generality, assume \(|\mu|(B) = \infty\). Repeating this process yields a partition \(\{A_n\}_n\) of \(E\) such that \(|\mu(A_n)| > 1\) for all \(n\). But then
    \[
        \mu(E) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \mu(A_n)
    \]
    cannot converge, as \(|\mu(A_n)|\) does not tend to \(0\). So every set \(E \in \fr{M}\) must have finite total variation, and in particular this holds for \(E = X\) as well.
\end{proof}

Now we can give some structure to complex measures on a measurable space. 

\begin{proposition}{Complex Measures Form a Normed Vector Space}*
    Let \((X, \fr{M})\) be a measurable space. The set of complex measures \(\{\mu : \fr{M} \to \bb{C}\}\) forms a normed vector space, with norm \(\|\mu\| := |\mu|(X)\). 
\end{proposition}

\begin{definition}{Jordan Decomposition of Signed Measures}*
    Let \((X, \fr{M})\) be a measurable space, and suppose \(\mu : \fr{M} \to \bb{R}\) is a \tit{signed measure}. Then the \tit{positive and negative variations} of \(\mu\) are 
    \[
        \mu^+ = \tfrac{1}{2}(|\mu| + \mu), 
        \quad 
        \mu^- = \tfrac{1}{2}(|\mu| - \mu)
    \]

    which are both bounded positive measures, since \(\mu^+, \mu^- : \fr{M} \to [0, \infty)\). Furthermore, 
    \[
        \mu = \mu^+ - \mu^-, 
        \quad
        |\mu| = \mu^+ + \mu^-
    \]
    and this representation of \(\mu\) is its \tit{Jordan decomposition}. 
\end{definition}

\subsection{Absolute Continuity}

\begin{definition}{Absolute Continuity}*
    Let \((X, \fr{M})\) be a measurable space. Let \(\mu\) be a positive measure, and let \(\lambda\) be an arbitrary measure. Then \(\lambda\) is \tit{absolutely continuous with respect to} \(\mu\) if 
    \[
        \mu(E) = 0 \implies \lambda(E) = 0
        \qquad (E \in \fr{M})
    \]
    which is denoted by \(\lambda \ll \mu\). 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Concentration of Measure}*
    Let \((X, \fr{M}, \lambda)\) be a measure space. If there exists \(A \in \fr{M}\) such that
    \[
        \lambda(E) = \lambda(A \cap E)
        \qquad (E \in \fr{M})
    \]
    then \(\lambda\) is \tit{concentrated} on \(A\). This is equivalent to saying \(\lambda(E) = 0\) whenever \(E \cap A = \varnothing\).
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}{Mutually Singular Measures}*
    Let \((X, \fr{M})\) be a measurable space. Two measures \(\lambda_1, \lambda_2\) are \tit{mutually singular} if there exists \(A, B \in \fr{M}\) disjoint such that \(\lambda_1\) is concentrated on \(A\) and \(\lambda_2\) is concentrated on \(B\), denoted
    \[
        \lambda_1 \perp \lambda_2
    \]
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}{Basic Concentration Properties}*
    Suppose \(\mu, \lambda, \lambda_1, \lambda_2\) are measures on \((X, \fr{M})\) and \(\mu\) is positive. Then the following hold:
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \itemsep0em
        \item If \(\lambda\) is concentrated on \(A\), so is \(|\lambda|\). 
        \item If \(\lambda_1 \perp \lambda_2\), then \(|\lambda_1| \perp |\lambda_2|\). 
        \item If \(\lambda_1 \perp \mu\) and \(\lambda_2 \perp \mu\), then \(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 \perp \mu\).
        \item If \(\lambda_1 \ll \mu\) and \(\lambda_2 \ll \mu\), then \(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 \ll \mu\).
        \item If \(\lambda \ll \mu\), then \(|\lambda| \ll \mu\).
        \item If \(\lambda_1 \ll \mu\) and \(\lambda_2 \perp \mu\), then \(\lambda_1 \perp \lambda_2\). 
        \item If \(\lambda \ll \mu\) and \(\lambda \perp \mu\), then \(\lambda = 0\). 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

% \begin{proof}
%     \tit{Part (a).} If \(E \cap A = \varnothing\), then
%     \[
%         |\lambda|(E) = \sup \sum_{n=1}^\infty |\lambda(E_n)| 
%         = \sup \sum_{n=1}^\infty |\lambda(A \cap E_n)|
%         = |\lambda|(A \cap E)
%     \]
%     so that \(|\lambda|\) is concentrated on \(A\).
% \end{proof}
% 
% \begin{proof}
%     \tit{Part (b).} Since \(\lambda_1 \perp \lambda_2\), there exist \(A, B \in \fr{M}\) disjoint such that \(\lambda_1\) is concentrated on \(A\) and \(\lambda_2\) is concentrated on \(B\). From the previous part, \(|\lambda_1|\) is concentrated on \(A\) and \(|\lambda_2|\) is concentrated on \(B\), so \(|\lambda_1| \perp |\lambda_2|\).
% \end{proof}
% 
% \begin{proof}
%     \tit{Part (c).} There exists \(A_1, B_1\) disjoint such that \(\lambda_1\) is concentrated on \(A_1\) and \(\mu\) is concentrated on \(B_1\). Similarly, there exists \(A_2, B_2\) disjoint such that \(\lambda_2\) is concentrated on \(A_2\) and \(\mu\) is concentrated on \(B_2\). Let \(A = A_1 \cup A_2\) and \(B = B_1 \cap B_2\). Note that \(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2\) is concentrated on \(A\), and also \(\mu\) is concentrated on \(B\). Since \(A\) and \(B\) are disjoint, we conclude that \(\lambda_1 + \lambda_2 \perp \mu\).
% \end{proof}
% 
% \begin{proof}
%     \tit{Part (d).} This is obvious.
% \end{proof}
% 
% \begin{proof}
%     \tit{Part (e).} Suppose \(\mu(E) = 0\) for \(E \in \fr{M}\). Take any partition \(\{E_n\}_n\) of \(E\). Note \(\mu(E_n) = 0 \implies \lambda(E_n) = 0\) for all \(n\), since \(\mu\) is positive. Hence \(|\lambda| \ll \mu\). 
% \end{proof}
% 
% \begin{proof}
%     \tit{Part (f).} Let \(\lambda_2\) be concentrated on \(A\) and \(\mu\) be concentrated on \(B\). Since \(\mu(E) = 0 \implies \lambda_1(E) = 0\) whenever \(E \cap B = \varnothing\), \(\lambda_1\) is concentrated on \(B\). Hence \(\lambda_1 \perp \lambda_2\).
% \end{proof}
% 
% \begin{proof}
%     \tit{Part (g).} From the previous part, \(\lambda \perp \lambda\). Hence \(\lambda = 0\).
% \end{proof}

\begin{lemma}{Reduction of \(\sigma\)-Finite Measures}*
    Let \(X, \fr{M}\) be a measurable space, and let \(\mu\) be a positive \(\sigma\)-finite) measure. Then there exists \(w \in L^1(\mu)\) such that \(\oname{range}(w) \subseteq (0, 1)\). 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let \(X = \bigcup_n X_n\) where \(X_n\) are finite under \(\mu\). Define 
    \[
        w(x) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n(1 + \mu(X_n))} \cl{X}_{X_n}(x)
    \]

    Note that \(w\) is the limit of measurable functions and thus measurable. It satisfies \(0 < w(x) < 1\) for all \(x\), and it is integrable and \(L^1\) thanks to the Monotone Convergence Theorem. 
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}{Finite Measures Suffice}*
    The point of the preceeding lemma is that any \(\sigma\)-finite \(\mu\) can be replaced by a finite measure \(\tilde{\mu}\), namely \(d \tilde{\mu} = w \, d\mu\). It is finite since 
    \[
        \tilde{\mu}(E) = \left| \int_E \, \mr{d}\tilde{\mu} \right| 
        = \left| \int_E w \, \mr{d}\mu \right|
        \leq \int_X w \, \mr{d}\mu
        < \infty
    \]

    since \(w \in L^1(\mu)\).
\end{remark}

\begin{theorem}{Lebesgue-Radon-Nikodym}*
    Let \(X, \fr{M}\) be a measurable space, with measures \(\mu\) positive and \(\sigma\)-finite, \(\lambda\) complex. Then 
    \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
        \itemsep0em
        \item There eixst unique \(\lambda_a, \lambda_s\) complex measures such that \(\lambda = \lambda_a + \lambda_s\), satisfying \(\lambda_a \ll \mu\) and \(\lambda_s \perp \mu\).
        \item There exists a unique \(\frac{d\lambda_a}{d\mu} \in L^1(\mu)\) such that
        \[
            \lambda_a(E) = \int_E \frac{d\lambda_a}{d\mu} \, \mr{d}\mu
            \quad (E \in \fr{M})
        \]
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}

    TODO: revisit after Chapter 4, Hilbert Spaces.
